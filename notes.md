- in less than two years since its launch, developers have experienced the following while using GitHub Copilot:

    1. 46% of new code is now written by AI
    2. 55% faster overall developer productivity
    3. 74% of developers feel more focused on satisfying work

- Developed in collaboration with OpenAI, GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, an AI system created by OpenAI. OpenAI Codex has broad knowledge of how people use code and is more capable than GPT-3 in code generation, in part because it was trained on a data set that includes a larger concentration of public source code.

- GitHub Copilot is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim/Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

## features of GitHub copilot 
    1. A ChatGPT-like experience in your editor with GitHub Copilot Chat
    2. Copilot for Pull Requests - This new functionality is powered by OpenAIâ€™s new GPT-4 model, and adds support for AI-powered tags in pull-request descriptions through a GitHub app that organization admins and individual repository owners can install. These tags are automatically filled out by GitHub Copilot based on the changed code. Developers can then review or modify the suggested description.

    3. AI-generated answers about documentation
    4. Copilot for the command line interface (CLI) - Next to the editor and pull request, the terminal is the place where developers spend the most time. However, even the most proficient developers need to scroll through many pages to remember the precise syntax of many commands. GitHub Copilot CLI can compose commands and loops, and throw around obscure find flags to satisfy your query.
